This is my NixOS configuraiton. It's quite simple for now, but it'll be improved over time.
* TODOs
** PROJ General :computers:
*** TODO [#C] Move all of the configs into literates (preferably into this file)
my configs are managed via git anyways, so it's not a big deal
*** TODO [#A] Consider moving to ZFS instead of BTRFS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: moving-zfs
:END:
I've tested it on my server and it works great - to be done in the near future
*** IDEA [#C] Consider [[https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings?source=techstories.org][removing my darlings]]
This is probably a good idea with [[#moving-zfs][moving to ZFS]] as it won't take much additional time and I don't use much folders
stuff to keep:
- [ ] Projects folder
- [ ] documents
- [ ] Caches for customizaiton stuff
- [ ] VMs
- [ ] Photos (those are in nextcloud anyways, but it's nice to keep them locally as long as I have just enough space)

I don't know if I wan't to keep anything else - I'll probably know after deleting something important
